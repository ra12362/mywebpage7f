Kevin Draper of The New York Times noted KSI, Paul and the organisers' intention to bring a new audience to a 'stagnant' sport and highlights the fact both YouTubers sought coaching from world-champion boxers and trainers.[47] Several professional boxers expressed support for the event, highlighting the benefit it could bring to boxing in terms of expanding the sport's audience.[48]

After six three-minute rounds, KSI was the winner via split decision, with two judges scoring the fight 57–54 and 56–55 for KSI, while the third judge scored it 56–55 in favour of Paul.[49] When asked about a possible rematch, Paul expressed his support for the idea, but KSI rejected any prospect of a third fight against Paul, saying "It's done ...
