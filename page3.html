			<h3>A rematch between KSI and Paul was held on 9 November 2019 at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, and was promoted by Eddie Hearn.[45] Unlike the first fight, the rematch was a professional fight without the use of headgear.[46] KSI was trained by professional boxer, Viddal Riley, and Jeff Mayweather, uncle of Floyd Mayweather Jr.[47]

Some journalists criticised KSI and Paul for using the event as a 'cash grab' and questioned the legitimacy of the match as a professional bout, or questioned the choice of putting professional world-title bouts on an undercard to two YouTubers. The executive director of the California State Athletic Commission (the fight's sanctioning body), Andy Foster, defended the accusation that the YouTubers weren't fit to fight professionally, saying in an interview that "If they weren't YouTube stars, this fight is still approvable in every commission in this country as debut athletes". Kevin Draper of The New York Times noted KSI, Paul and the organisers' intention to bring a new audience to a 'stagnant' sport and highlights the fact both YouTubers sought coaching from world-champion boxers and trainers.[47] Several professional boxers expressed support for the event, highlighting the benefit it could bring to boxing in terms of expanding the sport's audience.[48]

After six three-minute rounds, KSI was the winner via split decision, with two judges scoring the fight 57–54 and 56–55 for KSI, while the third judge scored it 56–55 in favour of Paul.[49] When asked about a possible rematch, Paul expressed his support for the idea, but KSI rejected any prospect of a third fight against Paul, saying "It's done ... I'm on to the next thing</h3>

			<h3>KSI's fight with fellow British YouTuber Joe Weller, who had also never previously boxed as an amateur or professional, on 3 February 2018 at the Copper Box Arena in London was a success,[9] drawing 1.6 million live viewers, 21 million views within a day,[10][11] and over 25 million views over the next several days, becoming the most viewed white-collar boxing fight.[citation needed] After KSI won the fight and was awarded the YouTube Boxing Championship Belt, a non official and unrecognised belt created for this event,[citation needed] he called out the Paul brothers Jake and Logan. KSI initially challenged Logan Paul's younger brother Jake to face him in the ring.[12] Jake Paul was initially the one to fight KSI. However, Jake backed down, letting his older brother Logan step in to fight KSI, whilst younger brother Deji Olatunji (also known as ComedyShortsGamer) stepped in to fight Jake. Deji did not want to be fighting on the undercard of the fight, therefore it was agreed that the fight would be advertised with Deji and Jake's names being listed in the manner of a co-main event as to not provide either pair higher importance over the other. The two parties signed contracts agreeing to have two fights, one to be held on 25 August 2018 at the Manchester Arena in the United Kingdom,[13][14] and another to be held in February 2019 in the United States. Originally, Logan and Jake Paul wanted any fight to be held in a neutral venue, preferably Dubai, United Arab Emirates, but Logan had decided to go with the two-fight plan.[12]

In an interview with TMZ on 23 July 2018, KSI admitted his aspirations of turning professional after the fight saying "I wanna squeeze out every bit of relevancy from him (Logan Paul) and then move onto my bigger goal which is to go pro".[15] Professional boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, president of boxing promotion firm Matchroom Boxing, was questioned in an interview about signing KSI on a professional contract and responded "Yeah, I probably would. But he’s not gonna fight for £15,000, he’s just fought for £3 million!</h3>
