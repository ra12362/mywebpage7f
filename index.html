			<h1>The beginning<h1>
			<p>KSI registered his first account on YouTube under the username "JideJunior" in 2008 while in his early teens.[18] He registered his current YouTube account on 24 July 2009 under the name KSIOlajideBT, where he uploaded gaming–commentary videos of the FIFA video game series from his bedroom at his parents' house in Watford.[4][9] He dropped out of sixth form college to pursue his YouTube career once he was earning steady monthly revenue from his uploads. In an interview in 2014, he recounted asking his teacher whether he should drop-out. His teacher asked how much KSI was making from YouTube, to which KSI answered, "around £1,500 a month", which was more than his teacher earned. His parents initially disapproved, but later became supportive and featured in a number of his videos.</p>
		
			<h1>joining the sidemen<h1>	
				<p>In October 2013, KSI signed with Maker Studios' sub-network, Polaris.[24] Since 19 October 2013, KSI has been part of the British YouTube group known as the Sidemen.[25] The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise.[26][27]

In 2015, KSI published a biography titled KSI: I Am a Bellend.[28] The book was released on 24 September 2015 in the UK and five days later in the United States, and KSI toured to support the book from its release until 4 October 2015.[29]

In 2016, KSI and the Sidemen published Sidemen: The Book,[30] which sold 26,436 copies within three days and topped the hardback nonfiction charts.[31]

On 4 August 2017, KSI tweeted that he would be leaving the Sidemen, citing conflicts with fellow member, Ethan Payne.[citation needed] Shortly thereafter, he released a number of diss track videos criticising members of his then-former group, to which most of the members responded back with their own.[32] Later that month, KSI released a video in which he claimed that he was being deported from the United States for receiving an incorrect visa.[citation needed] In November 2017, KSI released a video discussing whether his supposed falling out with the Sidemen was real or fake, saying, "[the drama] wasn't entirely real but wasn't entirely fake either.<p>
